IMPORTANT NOTES !!

Be sure to have good knowledge of the following topics:

- Administration of Linux.
- Virtualization on Linux with kvm / qemu / libvirt.
- LinuxBridge and OpenVSwitch.
- Linux namespaces.
- Networks in general.
- OpenStack.
- NFS, GlusterFS.
- "Correct" Install of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS O/S.

This installer is ONLY for Unbuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bit (x86_64 / amd64). Do not
attempt to use it in another environment.


1.- Base repositories and installing Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS:

Make sure you have the Ubuntu 16.04 LTS repositories as they come installed by
default. Install the server with the normal options and include as extra
package: "OpenSSH Server".

If you are going to use a "Cinder Volume", remember to reserve the disk space for it.

Make sure you have updated the server:

apt-get update
apt-get -y upgrade

Mitaka repositories are already included on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS so you don't need to
include extra repos here.


You may need to reboot the server after the last command (specially if the
updates included a new kernel).


2.- System Control (/etc/sysctl.conf).

WARNING: This is VERY important!. Make sure you have the following items
configured in /etc/sysctl.conf:

net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=0

If you do not have configured this, please do it now and then reboot the
machine.


3. OpenVSWITCH:

First install openvswitch. Run the commands below (after placing the
repositories listed above):

apt-get -y install openvswitch-switch python-openvswitch
/etc/init.d/openvswitch-switch restart

Then, create the bridges:

First step: br-int (OpenStack integration switch/bridge):

ovs-vsctl add-br br-int

Next step: br-ethX (OpenStack networks switch/bridge). Example for "eth2"
interface:

ovs-vsctl add-br br-eth2
ovs-vsctl add-port br-eth2 eth2


NOTE: Always try to use an interface that is FREE and can be "dedicated" to
OpenStack. For other configurations, see the information that is available
online. It is not necessary 

to place the interfaces associated with the switches in
/etc/network/interfaces, unless you have "shared" and not dedicated to
OpenStack, or unless you are using special "vlan-based" configurations.

For more information, please refer to OpenStack main documentation site:
