ALERT: TROVE AND POSTGRESQL

The Mitaka version of trove is broken with postgresql database backend, at least with the default postgresql packages in Centos 7 and Ubuntu 14.04lts. When the installer try to make the "db-sync", the operation fails and the database tables are not completelly created, leaving trove in a completelly unusable state.

This is not the first time we encounter... "details"... when using postgresql as a database backend for OpenStack. If you plan to use trove, please meanwhile the bug is being addresed and corrected, stick with MySQL/MariaDB as a database backend. Note that this while this affects trove itself, it does not the datastores. You can use MySQL/MariaDB as config database backend, and still safelly use postgresql-based datastores.

The BUG is referenced in the following url:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/trove/+bug/1473226

This is also affecting recent versions of MariaDB and MySQL, but, in those engines there is a workaround which is applied in the Ubuntu-16.04lts version of our Installer.

END.-
